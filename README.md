### ðŸ”¸ Error 201 Wrong ECU Hardware Number 1406464 (BSU Not possible)
This error occurs when your ECU's Stock ROM is different than what ROM is flashed currently on it. Followed by the error is a 7 digit number, which usually corresponds with your current ROM's ECU SW Number. Take note of it.
- Open folder \EC-APPS\NFS\DATA - This is the directory for WinKFP, specifically where your Daten files are saved.
- If your ECU's stock rom is MS41.2 , open MDS412/MDS412.HWH with notepad | if it is MS41.1 , open MDS411/MDS411.HWH with notepad
- It will look like:
```bash
;Hardwarehistorie vom 28.01.2000 08:20
1438067A F , 1405854B F , 1406464C F , 1430144A F ;
```
edit the first entry with the ECU HW that came in the 201 error (mine was 1406464)
it will look like:
```bash
;Hardwarehistorie vom 28.01.2000 08:20
1406464 F , 1405854B F , 1406464C F , 1430144A F ;
```
---
Save the .HWH file and continue with step ðŸ”¹ Open WinKFP.

After Vin Flash is complete, **You must re-flash your Full and partial since a vin change reverts the ECU back to its stock ROM.**
